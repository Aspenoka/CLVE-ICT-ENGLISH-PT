<h1><p style="color:white;">Hello and welcome to this event!</h1>

<p style="color:white;">I pose a thought-provoking question to you: Who, in your view, stands as the paramount cornerstone and foundation of the church? The unequivocal answer echoes through history—Jesus, the Son of God. But why is this so? Why not attribute such significance to revered figures like St. Michael the Archangel or St. Eugene de Mazenod? Today, we embark on a journey of understanding, as I unravel the profound reasons behind Jesus's pivotal role in shaping the foundations of the church. Prepare to delve into the rich tapestry of beliefs and historical significance that elucidate the unparalleled importance of Jesus in the context of the church's establishment and enduring legacy.!</p>

<p style="color:white;">Jesus embarked on a divine mission on Earth, aiming to disseminate God's teachings and extend salvation to the less fortunate. His compassionate journey included remarkable miracles—curing lepers, resurrecting the dead, and feeding multitudes. Yet, reactions to his actions were diverse; some ardently followed him, while others harbored disdain. The culmination of his earthly saga was a sacrificial death, followed by a triumphant resurrection on the third day. Subsequently, Jesus ascended to the heavenly realm, symbolically passing a key to Peter, signifying access to the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p style="color:white;">The pivotal moment of Pentecost marked the dispersal of apostles worldwide, heralding the foundation of the church. A significant contributor to this growth was Paul, who played a pivotal role in amassing followers. His outreach extended particularly to the marginalized—poor and minorities in the cities of the Roman Empire. Thus, the narrative of Jesus and the apostles unfolded as a transformative force, leaving an enduring impact on the establishment and expansion of the Christian faith.</p>

<p style="color:white;">Let's delve into the profound analogy of a foundation, a crucial element that forms the bedrock of any building or house, holding the entire structure in steadfast unity. Much like the resilience required for a building to weather storms and withstand natural disasters, the strength of this foundation is paramount, as its integrity determines the resilience of the entire edifice. It stands as a testament to the enduring nature of the structure it supports. In the same way, we find Jesus symbolized as a rock, representing the unyielding foundation of the church. People like Moses, David, and Paul have referred to God and Jesus as their rock of righteousness, chief cornerstone of the church, and being a rock, with perfect work.</p>

<p style="color:white;">In summary, when faced with decisions, turning to Jesus for guidance is a wise choice. His role as the stalwart foundation of the church highlights his ability to provide strength and unity. Beyond the church, Jesus can also serve as the bedrock of our individual lives, offering stability and purpose. By seeking his guidance, practicing goodness, and maintaining humility, we may aspire to attain eternal life. With these reflections in mind, let us embark on the event with a sense of purpose and reverence.</p>
